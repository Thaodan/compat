;;; Commentary:

;; Find here the functionality added in Emacs 29.1, needed by older

;; Do NOT load this library manually.  Instead require `compat'.

;;; Code:

(eval-when-compile (require 'compat-macs))
(declare-function compat-maxargs-/= "compat" (func n))



(provide 'compat-29.1)
;;; compat-29.1.el ends here
